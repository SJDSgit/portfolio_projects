In this project, we attempt to predict the churn in the financial domain based on the banking sector dataset.

Firstly we explore the dataset to look for missing values and treat them accordingly before applying machine learning algorithms.

The missing values are treated with imputation.

To extract more information from the dataset, we apply feature engineering.

Moreover lastly, we provide some suggestions based on the analysis.

Tools used: Python (Pandas. NumPy, Sci-kit, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter.
