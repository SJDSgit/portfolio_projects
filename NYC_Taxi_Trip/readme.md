In this project, we have the NYC taxi trip duration dataset.

Firstly we explore the dataset to look for missing values and treat them accordingly.

Next, we check whether the fields have consistency, e.g., data type, and reformat the features where the inconsistency is present.

We visualize the data after performing Univariate and bivariate analyses.

Moreover lastly, we provide some suggestions based on the analysis.

Tools used: Python (Pandas. NumPy, Sci-kit, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter.
