## **Business Task**
When Danny looked over his Instagram page, the caption "80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!" mainly got his attention.
Danny was convinced of the idea but saw that selling pizza wouldn't be enough to secure the initial capital he needed to establish his new pizza empire. 

So, he came up with one more clever concept to add to it: he would Uberize it. As a result, Pizza Runner was born.

In addition to maxing up his credit card to pay freelance developers to create a mobile app to take orders from consumers, Danny began by hiring "runners" to bring fresh 
pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters, or Danny's house.
